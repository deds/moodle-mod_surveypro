known issues
************
- long text (using html editor) as child is not disabled by the parent even if in the same page: see MDL-25067. I found it is caused by the js of the editor.
- module icons are missing from head/admin/plugins.php overview report: see MDL-45723

Issues that were not fixed but that are no longer a problem:
************
MDL-29421: Form elements editor and filepicker do not support freezing. [Fixed locally by overriding corresponding classes]
